## About me
I have extensive experience in Internet marketing as a project manager and in my work I constantly dealt with the tasks of developing websites and applications for business. I understand the goals and objectives of the client good enough, so in my developer's working I will be able to use my experience to achieve the goals of the customers (and for its customers :) ).

Regularly drawing up technical tasks for developers, I became interested in the technical side of the task implementation. 
Studying at the technical university provided a knowledge base that helped me to implement amateur projects for use by my friends (I have created a couple of online stores on CSM, several landing pages using templates and constructors). 
Interest in the development has increased. I became actively interested in courses for mastering the necessary skills for a full-fledged entry into the profession.

**My strengths:**
* _understanding the business side of projects_
* _responsibility for a project_
* _deeply immersion in the essence of the problem/task_
* _diligent in achieving goals_
* _team Player_
* _ability to constantly learn and get new skills_

Changing profession opens up new opportunities for professional growth for me.
I like an abundance of resources for self-education in IT and a large community of developers.
I am sure that I can go this way and become a great Frontend developer.
